/// \section section_development_build Build
/// Before we can start building the actual firmware, we need to add the ESP-IDF

///
/// We'll try this out right away by starting one of three CMake build

///
/// \section section_development_flash Flash
/// In order to flash the generated binary (or actually, binaries) onto a board,
/// we need to put the board into the bootloader. This is done by
/// - Connecting the board to the USB-C port
/// - Setting the BOOT jumper
/// - Switching on the power supply
///
/// Afterwards we can use the `flash` command of the
/// [idf.py](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/\idf_ver/esp32s3/api-guides/tools/idf-py.html)
/// frontend to upload the firmware.
/// ```sh
/// idf.py flash
/// ```
///
/// \warning
/// Be careful, this command actually flashes 5 binaries at once and not just
/// the application. This includes things like the
/// [bootloader](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/\idf_ver/esp32s3/api-guides/bootloader.html),
/// the [partition
/// table](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/\idf_ver/esp32s3/api-guides/partition-tables.html)
/// and the [NVS
/// storage](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/\idf_ver/esp32s3/api-reference/storage/nvs_flash.html).
/// Again, you can find further details in \ref page_config. If you already have
/// a board with a running firmware and just want to flash the application, you
/// can do this with the following command.
/// ```sh
/// idf.py app-flash
/// ```
///
/// \section section_development_debug Debug
/// The idf.py frontend we just saw is only one of two ways to communicate with
/// our ESP chip over USB. The other way is the built-in JTAG interface.
/// Espressif's own documentation has a diagram that illustrates the two
/// possibilities well. The convenient part is that both connections are made
/// via the same USB cable. This is made possible by the ESP32-S3 chip itself,
/// which provides two USB channels, one for JTAG and the other for the USB
/// terminal connection we have already used.
///
/// \image html jtag-debugging-overview.jpg "JTAG debugging"
///
/// Before we can establish a debugging connection with GDB though, we need to
/// grant the appropriate rights to communicate with the OpenOCD device. To do
/// this, we download the [udev
/// rules](https://github.com/espressif/openocd-esp32/raw/master/contrib/60-openocd.rules)
/// from Espressif's [OpenOCD

/// \subsection subsection_config_nvs NVS
/// The `nvs` partition uses key-value pairs to store device settings,
/// locomotives and accessories. The default settings are contained in a CVS
/// file called
/// [`nvs.csv`](https://github.com/OpenRemise/Firmware/raw/master/nvs.csv) and
/// are included when flashing a firmware.
///
/// \subsection subsection_config_data Data
/// The data partition is currently reserved but unused. It is planned to use a
/// [LittleFS](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/\idf_ver/esp32s3/api-guides/file-system-considerations.html#littlefs-fs-section)
/// file system for this partition.
///
/// \section section_config_performance Performance
/// To ensure that the firmware runs smoothly, there are a few important points
/// to consider regarding performance.
///
/// \subsection subsection_config_performance_cpu CPU
/// With the dual core architecture of the ESP32-S3, it is **very important** to
/// pay close attention to which task is running on which core. To simplify
/// this, Espressif provides a FreeRTOS extension in the form of the
/// [`xTaskCreatePinnedToCore`](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/\idf_ver/esp32s3/api-reference/system/freertos_additions.html?highlight=xtaskcreatepinnedtocore#_CPPv423xTaskCreatePinnedToCore14TaskFunction_tPCKcK8uint32_tPCv11UBaseType_tPC12TaskHandle_tK10BaseType_t)
/// function, which allows to explicitly specify the core to which the task
/// should get pinned to.
///
/// One pitfall that can easily occur here is not considering the initialization
/// of the peripherals. Although Espressif offers its own core-considering API
/// when creating tasks, this is completely missing for all peripherals. This
/// means that while initializing a peripheral, tasks and interrupts may be
/// allocated in the background, which either have their own Kconfig option
/// (e.g.
/// [LWIP_TCPIP_TASK_AFFINITY_CPU0](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/\idf_ver/esp32s3/api-reference/kconfig.html#config-lwip-tcpip-task-affinity)),
/// or are simply allocated on the core that called the function. To work around
/// this, there is the utility function `invoke_on_core()`, which executes a
/// passed function on an assigned core.
///
/// \note
/// `invoke_on_core()` works in blocking mode and is really only used during
/// startup.
///
/// The following table provides an overview of the distribution of tasks across
/// cores.

///
/// \note
/// Espressif itself refers to core 0 as `PRO_CPU` and core 1 as `APP_CPU`. The
/// official recommendation is to reserve core 0 for protocol-related processing
/// such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, while the rest of the application's tasks should
/// run on core 1.
///
/// \subsection subsection_config_performance_iram IRAM
/// By default, all code is executed from flash cache. This means that it is
/// possible for the CPU to have to wait on a "cache miss" while the next
/// instructions are loaded from flash. This is not an option for real-time
/// critical code. Fortunately, the ESP-IDF framework offers a solution for this
/// in the form of the IRAM (Instruction RAM) attribute. Functions that contain
/// the `IRAM_ATTR` macro in the signature are automatically placed in the IRAM
/// section.
///
/// In addition to individual application functions, ESP-IDF code from various
/// peripherals (or at least parts of it) must also be placed in IRAM. To do
/// this, the corresponding kConfig option, e.g.,
/// `CONFIG_GPIO_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM`, must be enabled.
///
/// \subsection subsection_config_performance_wifi WiFi
/// Espressif has a dedicated article on [How to Improve Wi-Fi
/// Performance](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/\idf_ver/esp32s3/api-guides/wifi.html#how-to-improve-wi-fi-performance),
/// which, in addition to the various recommended configurations, also contains
/// a lot of information about how the Wi-Fi/LwIP protocol stack actually works.
/// Unfortunately, most settings consume a lot of internal RAM, which is why the
/// firmware mainly stays at the defaults.
///
/// There is one exception, however. The firmware increases the size of all
/// `*RECVMBOX` settings. The number of these mailboxes largely determines how
/// many messages can be queued for various protocols. The default size is quite
/// small and causes burst transmissions of many small messages to result in
/// errors.
///
/// For further details regarding general performance I recommend the Espressif
/// article [Speed
/// Optimization](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/\idf_ver/esp32s3/api-guides/performance/speed.html).

/// \page page_architecture Architecture
/// \details \tableofcontents
/// The entire software stack is divided into three layers. At the top are the
/// interfaces, which represent the connections to the outside world. In the
/// middle, various services run as middlewares that take care of processing the
/// data and generate various output signals from it. And underneath that there
/// are drivers that use these signals to control the hardware outputs. A more
/// detailed version of the upcoming diagram can be found at the [bottom of the
/// page](#section_architecture_diagram) (\emoji :warning: not mobile friendly).

/// \section section_architecture_interfaces Interfaces
/// The interface layer contains modules that are used to receive and transmit
/// data. They initialize various communication peripherals such as USB and WiFi
/// and manage the data transfer via them. The received data is processed and
/// then forwarded to the corresponding services in the middleware layer.
///
/// \section section_architecture_middlewares Middlewares
/// The modules in the middleware layer contain services that connect the
/// interfaces with the outputs in the driver layer. An example of this is the
/// mdu::Service, which can accept a
/// [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) connection from the
/// ::http::sta::Server and then processes commands for an update of the decoder
/// software. The service then starts the corresponding \ref
/// out::track::mdu::task_function "MDU task" in the driver layer, which then
/// generates the necessary signals on the track. The communication is
/// bidirectional, received feedback is sent back to the server via service. In
/// more complex situations, middleware services may also communicate directly
/// with each other. An example of this is the communication between the
/// dcc::Service and the z21::Service.
///
/// \section section_architecture_drivers Drivers
/// In the driver layer there are modules that contain some form of IO. For the
/// most part, these are modules that generate signals controlled by middleware
/// services. Other modules initialize various hardware peripherals such as the
/// ADC or WiFi.
///
/// \section section_architecture_storage Storage
/// Although these modules do not necessarily represent a layer, they are still
/// a separate part of the architecture and manage the different flash memory
/// partitions. Currently this only involves the
/// [nvs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/\idf_ver/esp32s3/api-reference/storage/nvs_flash.html)
/// module which stores settings or locomotives in a key-value pair system. All
/// modules are considered global and can be accessed from all other layers.
